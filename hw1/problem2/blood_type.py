# Proportion of gene types in population
#   p = proportion of A gene
#   q = proportion of B gene
#   r = proportion of O gene
#   p + q + r = 1

# Questions
#   How can p + q + r = 1 if people can have two different genes at the same time?


# PROBLEM A
# Probability for having specific types
#   AA: p^2
#   BB: q^2
#   OO: r^2
