Homework 1 Problem 1

A.
If 2499 boat days are allowed each year, then the steady state harvest rate
be at a maximum value of 3749.5 whales per year. The steady state population
would be 150,041 whales.

B.
The sensitivity of the optimal number of boat days to r = 0.05 is 0.019. So a
1% increase in r results in a 1.9% increase in the optimal number of boat days.
This makes sense because if the intrinsic growth rate of the whales is larger,
then more boat days could be allowed to maximize the steady state harvest rate.

C.
